<p>michaeldouglas.xyz has a no-refund policy. Due to the time-consuming nature of our high-quality work, we do not offer any refunds.</p>
<p>We offer unlimited revisions during the project to ensure clients are happy with the final deliverables. However, if clients are not happy with the work we will make every effort to revise the project to satisfy the client, within the scope of the existing contract and a reasonable time-frame. Or, if the client chooses, we can stop working and provide them with the incomplete source files for the project.</p>
<p>Any future changes requested after a project has ended will be treated as a new project. Requiring the designer to create a new brief and a new quote for the work.</p>
<h3>12: Project File Delieverables</h3>
<p>When a project has ended we send a Project Conclusion Message to the client and remind them to download all of the files related to their project from Trello. Due to space limitations and cost, we do not store client files. We give clients 5 business days to download and test their files before we delete them.</p>
