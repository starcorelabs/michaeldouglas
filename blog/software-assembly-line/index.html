  <h1>Software Assembly Line</h1>
  <p>2024-05-05</p>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/software-assembly-line.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>A couple weeks ago someone said they didn't understand my previous job as a UX/UI Designer. It got me thinking about the best way to explain what UX/UI Design is and what designers actually do.</p>
<p>Before I explain my last role he's a summary of what UX and UI mean. UX/UI are two different overlapping jobs combined into one profession.</p>
<p>UX stands for User Experience. UX Designers research the best way to layout a software interface for a project based on universal design principles, psychology, and user feedback.</p>
<p>UI stands for User Interface. UI Designers focus on the look and feel of the interface. Using the results of the UX Design research to choose the correct fonts, colors, spacing, and components to make it easy to use the software.</p>
<p>Now that you have a bit of background we can move forward.</p>
<p>My previous job was part of a team that operated like a large assembly line that worked together to build web applications and other software.</p>
<p>As the UX/UI Designer I put together all the business requirements and user needs into graphical blueprints of what the web application should look like. The blueprints could take the form of simple gray scale wireframes or something more complex like full color click-through prototypes. It all depends on what the company asked me to do.</p>
<p>Working for a medium to large sized corporate company as part of a team that builds software is a complex process. There are a lot of bureaucratic policies and processes to navigate. Aside from the task assignments through the ticking system and the endless meetings where it seems like nothing got done.</p>
<p>The software assembly line reminded me of a mechanical equivalent from a show called, &quot;How Its Made&quot;. I loved the episode where they showed how glass bottles are made.</p>
<h3>The ideal software assembly line:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with a written detailed process for data gathering and logical evidence-based decision-making. This is required to ensure everyone on the team is focused on business goals, not their personal agenda. The team is not usually not the client or customer. So their opinions of what looks good or how the software should function is</li>
<li>Business Goals</li>
<li>Project Goals</li>
<li>Requirements gathering - not enough user data from surveys and interviews.</li>
<li>Specifications - based on the ego and mood of the CEO or department manager.</li>
<li>Design Brief and Style Guide - Documents that define the details of the project, its goals, how it looks, and functions.</li>
<li>Component library / UI Kit</li>
<li>Wireframe - Iteration on component placement is best done at this stage</li>
<li>Mockup - There should be no iteration at this stage. Once complete the design is frozen.</li>
<li>Interactive Prototype - This gives the client and developers a general ideal of how users will move through the application. It is not and should not be a 1:1 representation of the final software. The design should never be a single source of truth. That's what the Design Brief is for.</li>
<li>Hand-off to developers</li>
<li>Front-end Development - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks, libraries.</li>
<li>Secure API - to send and receive data between the Front-end and back-end</li>
<li>Back-end programming - Business logic</li>
<li>Code freeze</li>
<li>Testing / QA</li>
<li>Bug fixing</li>
<li>Deploy to production</li>
<li>More bug fixing</li>
</ul>
<p>This whole process is managed through a ticketing system. Every member of the team is assigned specific tasks.</p>
<p>The company could pick either SCRUM or Agile as its management framework. Both are time-wasting forms of micromanaging.</p>
<p>Forcing the whole team to stop working to attend a meeting where the clueless manager will ask why no one is working.</p>
<p>Production stops every time management holds a meeting to feel important or tell their subordinates what to do. The main problem is most managers waste time treating meetings like a stage where they can show off and talk about themselves.</p>
