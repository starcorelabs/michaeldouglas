  <h1>My Design Process</h1>
  <p>2021-10-02</p>
  <a href="/blog">Back to List</a>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/color-palette.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>In the design world, a small industry has grown around selling the “perfect” design process. People write books, make courses, and argue online about the best way to design things.</p>
<p>The truth is simple: there is no single perfect process.</p>
<p>Different designers work in different environments. What matters most is having a process that is clear, flexible, and repeatable.</p>
<h3>Where Design Processes Come From</h3>
<p>Most colleges teach <strong>rigid design processes</strong>. These processes are meant to help students learn how to think and solve problems. Over time, large companies adopted these same ideas, but added layers of rules, meetings, and paperwork.</p>
<p>What starts as a helpful guide often turns into a slow, complex system inside big organizations.</p>
<p>One of the most common models taught in school is <strong>Design Thinking</strong>.</p>
<h3>The Classic Design Thinking Model</h3>
<p>Here is the version many designers learn in college:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Discovery</strong> – Learn about users and understand their needs through research.</li>
<li><strong>Define</strong> – Clearly state the problem you are trying to solve.</li>
<li><strong>Ideate</strong> – Brainstorm ideas and challenge old assumptions.</li>
<li><strong>Prototype</strong> – Create early versions of the solution.</li>
<li><strong>Test</strong> – Try the solution with users and learn what works.</li>
</ol>
<p>On paper, this process makes sense. It gives structure to creative work and helps teams stay focused.</p>
<p>The problem begins when companies treat this process like a strict rulebook instead of a flexible guide.</p>
<p>In large corporations, each step can turn into weeks of meetings, approvals, and documents. Teams end up spending more time following the process than solving real problems.</p>
<p>Design thinking should <strong>support</strong> good design, not slow it down.</p>
<h3>Finding the Middle Ground</h3>
<p>Some designers believe creative work is too messy and human to ever fit into a process. Others follow processes so closely that creativity disappears.</p>
<p>I prefer to work somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>I keep creativity free from heavy rules, while still using a clear step-by-step structure. This helps me stay organized and helps stakeholders understand how work moves forward. It also gives them a chance to give input at the right time.</p>
<p>Below are the general guidelines I use on every project.</p>
<h3>My Core Design Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Never work without a contract</strong> <br/>
Get everything in writing, including signoff on completed work. People forget things, moods change, and written agreements protect everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Always be ready to stop</strong> <br/>
No matter how much time or effort you’ve put in, sometimes stopping is the right move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Form follows function</strong> <br/>
If a product is hard to use, it doesn’t matter how pretty it looks. A broken product with nice colors is still broken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clearly define the problem</strong> <br/>
If a stakeholder doesn’t know what they want, you can’t design it. Designers are not mind readers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Question the requirements</strong> <br/>
Ask, “Are we solving the right problem?” Bad requirements lead to bad results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remove what isn’t needed</strong> <br/>
If a feature or step doesn’t add value, delete it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Iterate through drafts</strong> <br/>
Try many ideas. Most good solutions come after several attempts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplify and optimize</strong> <br/>
Clear and simple usually beats clever and complex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plan for delays</strong> <br/>
Expect indecision, changing priorities, and committee reviews. Slow planning saves time later.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>My Workflow Stages</h3>
<p>I break my work into clear stages and require signoff at each one before moving forward. This prevents wasted effort and keeps projects moving.</p>
<h3>Stage 1: Requirements Gathering</h3>
<p>I start by gathering all major requirements upfront. The goal is to make big decisions early and leave small details for later.</p>
<p>This lets me work faster because I don’t need to stop for constant approvals or missing information.</p>
<p>Ideally, decisions are based on data, user feedback, and industry standards. In reality, many decisions are based on personal taste. When that happens, I document it and move forward.</p>
<p>Once the goal and direction are clear, I begin designing.</p>
<h3>Stage 2: Application Flowchart</h3>
<p>Next, I create an application flowchart that shows every screen and how users move through the product.</p>
<p>This step helps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spot missing or unnecessary screens</li>
<li>Clarify user paths</li>
<li>Give stakeholders a clear “map” of the product</li>
</ul>
<p>Many problems are solved right here before design even begins.</p>
<h3>Stage 3: Wireframes</h3>
<p>After the flowchart is approved, I create wireframes. These show layout and structure without visual polish.</p>
<p>This is the best stage for feedback because changes are fast and low-cost. I encourage stakeholders to be very critical here.</p>
<p>For freelance work, I always get signoff before moving forward. Any later changes affect time and cost.
In corporate settings, changes often happen later, which slows progress. I try to improve this culture when possible.</p>
<h3>Stage 4: Prototype</h3>
<p>Once wireframes are approved, I create a detailed prototype that shows how the final product will look and behave.</p>
<p>At this point, most big decisions should already be made. The goal is final approval so the design can be handed off to developers with confidence.</p>
