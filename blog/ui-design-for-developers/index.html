  <h1>UI Design for Developers</h1>
  <p>2025-01-26</p>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/cobble-bridge.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Recently, I was on LinkedIn reading posts from UX/UI Designers talking about how they are struggling to find a new job due to all the mass layoffs and ghost jobs. While simultaneously I saw Developers complaining about being expected to do Design work without extra compensation.</p>
<p>Some Developers said they were tired of writing code and wanted a less stressful and slower-paced career path. They falsely assumed switching to UX/UI Design would be easier while paying them at a similar rate.</p>
<p>Instead of replying to them individually, I decided to combine all my thoughts into this post.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you're a developer wanting to learn UX/UI Design there are plenty of free courses on YouTube that will teach you the basics.</p>
<p>Please consider the pros and cons of learning another career path. If you work in a corporate environment and want to collaborate better with the design team, then ask them how to do that. Or, if you're burnt out on coding, like I was, and want to change careers then learning Design might work for you. Remember it takes time to become proficient with the skills and tools of design. The grass is greener where you water it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that learning Design might incentivize your employer to give you more work without extra compensation. No one wants to work a second job for free.</p>
<h3>Myths About Design</h3>
<ol>
<li>Design is art.<br/>
False, design is not art, the process is more analytical than emotional. It takes business requirements, user data, psychology, and design principles to lay out interfaces that make it easier for end users to use software and websites.</li>
<li>Design is learning to run design software.<br/>
False, while it is important to know how to use design software. It's better to have the transferrable skills of a designer so you can create design solutions with nothing more than pencil and paper.</li>
<li>Design is like slapping a coat of paint on a project to make it look good.<br/>
False, design is a process to solve problems for end users in a way that makes the software easy for them to understand and interact with. Design is not always visual because form follows function. Design can reduce the number of clicks it takes to complete a form. Or it can be mapping all the screens that make up a website to reduce the cognitive load on end users who navigate the site.</li>
<li>Developers have the same mindset and skills as a Designer.<br/>
False, Developers and Designers think and operate differently. While a Developer can use a UI Kit like Bootstrap, Material UI, or Apple's UI kit to create layouts, they will over-engineer the solution because developers are rewarded with status and bonuses for solving complex problems. On the other hand, Designers are rewarded when they make software interfaces as simple and streamlined as possible. Helping a non-technical grandma with poor eyesight use the software.</li>
<li>A Developer can be expected to do the same work as a designer, without extra compensation.<br/>
Partially true, with the mass layoffs corporate companies have done over the last few years many Developers are being forced to take on the job of a Designer, without getting paid for it. Corporate jobs are specialized, requiring a 4 year degree or equivalent experience, to qualify. So a Developer might struggle to create basic designs on top of their complex programming work. The quality of their designs won't be at the same level as a dedicated Designer.</li>
<li>A Developer can use generative AI to replace a Designer.<br/>
Partially true, Developers can use systems like ChatGPT or Midjourney to hallucinate the bare-bones of a visual design. Unfortunately, AI is limited to creating amalgamations of designs it's already seen. It lacks the creativity to re-imagine a whole project and its underlying structure from a more streamlined perspective. These limits combined with a Developer who lacks design training will result in more over-engineered visually boring corporate software and websites.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cons of being a Designer</h3>
<ol>
<li>Non-designers think they can do your job better than you. They don't see you struggling to solve problems. All they see are the fancy graphics and streamlined solutions, which make Design look easy. You will be consistently challenged to defend your designs. Even if you didn't have decision-making power and were assigned tasks.</li>
<li>It takes a year of daily study and practice to learn the basics of design. Sure, you can watch some YouTube video courses or pay for a boot camp to jump-start your education. But, until you've worked as a Designer for at least a year in a corporate environment you won't understand how deep the rabbit hole goes.</li>
<li>On average Designers earn 30% less than Developers. If you're happy writing code then stick with it. Being a Designer doesn't pay as well.</li>
<li>Many companies don't understand, respect, or value design as much as development work. Again, non-designers view design as slapping a coat of paint on a completed project to make it look pretty. But that's not how design works.</li>
<li>When companies decide to perform layoffs they usually start with sales, marketing, and design. So your position as a Designer is never stable or reliable.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Without a passion for Design the juice is not worth the squeeze. Consider all the pros and cons before learning a new career path.</p>
<p>It's important to review your reasons for learning UX/UI Design. The career path of a Designer has its challenges, doesn't pay as much as software development, and many corporate companies do not understand or value it as much as programming.</p>
