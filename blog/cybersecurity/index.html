    <h1>Cybersecurity</h1>
    <p>2024-10-25</p>

    <p><h3>Nothing Online Feels Safe Anymore (And What You Can Do)</h3>
<p>Almost every day, I read about another website getting hacked. Millions of email addresses and passwords are stolen at once. Recently, even trusted sites like the Internet Archive were attacked. New software and hardware security problems are found all the time.</p>
<h3>Big Tech Companies Don’t Help</h3>
<p>Google tracks what people do online and sells that data to advertisers. Apple charges high prices for its devices and often tells customers to buy new ones instead of fixing old ones. Adobe locks people into expensive subscriptions and makes canceling hard. Microsoft has turned Windows 11 into a system filled with ads and tracking, while ending support for Windows 10 in October 2025. This forces people to upgrade or switch systems.</p>
<p>Many of these companies now say users do not truly own the hardware or software they buy. They also give themselves permission to use customer data and creative work to train their AI systems—for free.</p>
<p>Because of this, nothing in our connected digital world feels fully safe.</p>
<h3>“That Won’t Happen to Me” Is a Dangerous Thought</h3>
<p>I have family and friends who don’t take cybersecurity seriously. They often say, “That doesn’t apply to me.”</p>
<p>I’ve worked in Information Technology for over 20 years, and I can tell you this: it only takes one small mistake.</p>
<p>I’ve seen smart, well-trained office workers click a bad email link by accident. That single click infected an entire company. Computers were locked, data was stolen, and work stopped for days. The company lost thousands of dollars before the problem was fixed. The employee was written up and warned they could be fired if it happened again.</p>
<p>For home users, it’s even worse. If your computer gets hacked, there is no security team to call. One bad link or download can lock your files, steal your money, or take over your accounts.</p>
<h3>There Is No Magic Fix</h3>
<p>Many people want one simple tool to keep them safe. Sadly, that doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is like personal hygiene. Taking one shower doesn’t keep you clean forever. In the same way, one antivirus program is not enough. Staying safe online takes habits and awareness.</p>
<p>Most of your personal data isn’t even on your computer. It lives on company websites—social media, banks, stores, and more. If just one employee at those companies makes a mistake, millions of people’s data can be exposed.</p>
<p>That’s the reality of the digital world today.</p>
<h3>10 Simple Cybersecurity Tips</h3>
<ol>
<li>Nothing is 100% secure. Technology changes fast. What works today may not work next year.</li>
<li>You can’t fully escape the internet. Banks, utilities, and governments still store your data online.</li>
<li>Freeze your credit. Create free accounts with Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion and freeze your credit to stop identity theft.</li>
<li>Don’t trust unexpected emails, texts, or calls. If someone claims to be from your bank or Microsoft, hang up and call the company yourself.</li>
<li>Learn social engineering tricks. Hackers try to trick you, not hack computers directly.</li>
<li>Keep personal details private. Don’t share things like your pet’s name or school history online.</li>
<li>Use strong, unique passwords. Never reuse passwords. Use two-factor authentication.</li>
<li>Delete old accounts. Fewer accounts mean less data exposed.</li>
<li>Use safer software. Browsers like Firefox or Brave help block dangerous sites. Secure systems like macOS or beginner-friendly Linux options are safer by default.</li>
<li>Back up your data. Use an external drive so you don’t lose important files.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>There is no silver bullet for cybersecurity. But understanding the risks and building good habits can make a big difference.
The online world is powerful, useful, and dangerous at the same time. The more informed you are, the better choices you can make—and the safer you’ll be.</p>
