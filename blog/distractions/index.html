  <h1>Distractions</h1>
  <p>2024-11-12</p>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/pine-forest.png" alt="img"></p>
<ul>
<li>Main topic - I've allow myself to get distracted by people and things that don't have my best interest in mind.</li>
<li>Choices and Consequences - In life I make choices and live with the consequences. It's up to me to make positive choices that move me toward my goals. I cannot blame other people or society for my situation. That would rob me of the opportunity to change it. If I'm unhappy with my life then it's up to me to make better choices and take action to change it.</li>
<li>Nothing Better To Do - There are a few people who interrupt me because they have nothing better to do. They have the false idea they have to go through another person to get what they want. Many of them would rather complain than learn new skills and work for what they want.</li>
<li>No Contest - Some people want to distract me because they view life as a zero sum competitive game. They falsely assume the only way they can win is if other people lose.</li>
<li>Plan to Succeed - Success is subjective and looks different to everyone. Some people want status and wealth. Other want a stress free quiet life. The goal determines the type of work required to achieve it.</li>
<li>Summary - It's up to me to define success. To achieve my goals, I must avoid distractions and work daily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently I caught myself getting distracted by family, friends, my crazy neighbor, the road construction crew, YouTube, games, the news, random websites, and writing in this blog.</p>
<p>Note: I will be taking a break from writing.</p>
<p>While none of these things are bad in themselves. I have allowed them to interrupt my focus on my business.</p>
<p>It's up to me to put in the daily work to accomplish my goals. Paying attention to those distractions doesn't help me get my work done.</p>
<p>If I fail to make my small business successful no one will save me. As an adult, I must manage my time, attention, and effort to make daily progress.</p>
<p>I have learned from people wiser than me that running a successful small business is a marathon, not a sprint.</p>
<h3>Nothing Better To Do</h3>
<p>I know many intelligent and talented people who could be wildly successful if only they stopped allowing distractions to derail their focus.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some immature people have nothing better to do than try to interrupt and distract others from their work.</p>
<p>They cannot or will not accept responsibility for the consequences of their own choices. They would rather blame other people or society for their frustrating situation.</p>
<p>They compare themselves to others and become envious. They see a snapshot of a person's life through a keyhole and fail to see the struggles and pain they've endured to get where they are.</p>
<p>A sad rare few who operate from a scarcity worldview assume success is a zero-sum game. They mistakenly think other's success takes away from them in some way. But intelligent people know that's not how the world works.
There are more than enough resources and opportunities to go around.</p>
<p>The issue is opportunities are dressed in problems and look like work.</p>
<h3>No Contest</h3>
<p>Some people try to distract me from my work because they treat life like a game. They are upset that I'm not playing their game by their rules.</p>
<p>They've accepted the game of consumer culture. They believe the accumulation of status and money is the only measure of success.</p>
<p>I haven't figured out why it annoys them that I'm not playing that game by those rules.</p>
<p>In my view, it's a pointless competition. Because my main goal is peace.</p>
<p>I'm not a fan of Apple computers. It's they are not competing with anyone. Apple sets the standard that other companies try to mimic or compete with.</p>
<p>I'm only in competition with who I was yesterday. It's me versus myself.</p>
<p>Those frustrated people who attempt to compete with me haven't realized they can simply set their standards and wait for those playing their game to catch up with them.</p>
<h3>Plan to Succeed</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If you fail to plan, you're planning to fail. So plan to succeed!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Success is subjective and will look different to everyone.</p>
<p>It all depends on their goals. Consider the differences between a commercial pilot, a popular musician, and a small business owner.<br>
They will all define success differently.</p>
<p>Even two different small business owners in the same category will have different goals and ideas of what success means to them.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It's up to me to define success. To achieve my goals, I must avoid distractions and work daily.</p>
<p>I wish you luck in achieving yours.</p>
