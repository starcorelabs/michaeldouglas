  <h1>I Do Not Write Code</h1>
  <p>2023-04-21</p>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/laptop-code.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Recently two different technical recruiters messaged me through LinkedIn with open UX/UI Design roles.</p>
<p>I was hesitantly interested because I know how shady companies are these days and how most technical recruiters are non-technical and don’t know the difference between Design and Development.</p>
<p>My first question is always, &quot;Can you send me a job description with a salary range?&quot;</p>
<p>Most of the time they will paste the job description into LinkedIn’s tiny chat window which messes up the formatting and makes it hard to read. They rarely include a salary range.</p>
<p>Before reading the job description, my second question is, “Does this role require me to write code?”</p>
<p>They reply with, “Yes…” and then they give me a short explanation of the kind of coding required for the job.</p>
<p>My usual reply is, “I’m a Designer. I do not write code. You need a Developer or Engineer. Please change the job title to UX Engineer so you can attract the right candidates.”</p>
<p>They thank me for my suggestion and then end the chat session. I doubt they change the job title.</p>
<p>I understand they are doing the job assigned to them. They don’t understand the differences between Designers and Developers, and most don’t care. They are playing a numbers game. Attempting to find as many applicants to throw at a job opening as possible. So when someone from their pool of candidates gets hired they get a bonus. That’s the game.</p>
<p>I’m looking for a way to filter out non-technical recruiters or find a way to educate them on the difference between Designers and Developers. I want to give them a brief example of why any position that combines both skill sets into one job is a bad idea for applicants. Or, at the very least keep them from wasting my time.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>This year many corporate companies have boasted about record profits and their CEOs have earned 100% and more over their normal salary.</p>
<p>While at the same time, these companies are committing mass layoffs to save themselves money. They call it trimming the fat but we know it is corporate greed.</p>
<p>Their top executives refuse to take a pay cut. Instead, they’ve eliminated whole divisions so they can pocket the difference. This is a short-sighted gain in my opinion.</p>
<p>After committing mass layoffs these same companies are trying to hire people to replace those let go due to their high salaries. Is salary discrimination a thing?</p>
<p>One of the many ways these companies try to save money is by combining two or more jobs into one. Offering double the work at a lower salary. This is a major red flag in my book and a sign to avoid working for any corporation that behaves this way.</p>
<p>Most people wouldn’t buy a case of 12 Pepsi’s for double the price of 12 individual cans. That’s a bad deal.</p>
<p>But that’s essentially what these companies have done by combining two or more jobs into one.</p>
<p>Here’s a real-world example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A UX/UI Designer Bachelor’s Degree takes 4 years and has an average salary of $80k</li>
<li>A Software Developer Bachelor’s Degree takes 4 years and has an average salary of $100k</li>
<li>A UX Engineer is a combination of both those skillsets with an average salary of $120K</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a $60k a year loss in salary with double the daily workload. That is not a good deal.</p>
<p>They are acting shady by combining two jobs into one to save themselves money. With no loyalty to their employees as demonstrated by all these mass layoffs.</p>
<p>Few people will be great at UX/UI Design or Software Development. Holding the unrealistic expectation that one person will be great at both is like believing Unicorns are real. They are setting themselves up for frustration and the employee for failure.</p>
<p>As an employee, it is better to specialize in one skill set to provide the highest quality solutions for your employer. So they can provide the highest quality service to their customers.</p>
<h3>Why I do not write code</h3>
<p>I never enjoyed writing code. I learned to do it because it paid better than my previous job taking tech support calls.</p>
<p>About 5 years ago I got burnt out writing HTML and CSS code. The JavaScript libraries and frameworks seemed to update every week. I couldn't keep up with 7 different moving targets. I needed a less stressful daily workload.</p>
<p>I decided to change careers. I spent a few years improving my Graphic Design and UX/UI Design skills.</p>
<p>For the last 2 years, I was a Lead UX/UI Designer at a large company. While the job had its challenges I enjoyed the design process and the daily work of creating graphics.</p>
<p>As a visual thinker, I’ve found that design works for me. I’ll leave software development to people better suited for it.</p>
