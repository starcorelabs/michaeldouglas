  <h1>Minding My Business</h1>
  <p>2024-09-21</p>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/oldship.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>It's been a while since my last update. Please read my revised <a href="/about">About</a> page.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>When you ask the question, <em>&quot;What's Mike doing?&quot;</em> Remember this photo of me at home alone, doing things I enjoy on my computer. This is what I'm doing 99.99% of the time.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/whats-mike-doing.png" alt="img"></p>
<h3>Blog</h3>
<p>This website (michaeldouglas.xyz) was originally set up as my UX/UI Designer Portfolio when I was looking for a job.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/mdux.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Because I'm focused on running my own business I don't need a portfolio. So I've converted this site to a personal blog.</p>
<h3>Social Media</h3>
<p>I do not trust social media companies. They make money selling my information to advertisers and training their AI on my posts. That's why my Facebook is a shell. I've deleted everything from my profile. I don't post anything or follow people.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/my-facebook.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Most people post on Facebook for attention and validation. No judgment against anyone who likes or uses Facebook, but it's not for me. I use Facebook for the Marketplace, not for socializing.</p>
<p>Rarely, I'll go to a specific person's profile and catch up on their posts. I'm happy they are doing things they enjoy. Usually, the things people post don't appeal to me.</p>
<p>I don't have the Facebook app installed on my phone. I check Facebook through my browser once a week on Friday afternoon. Otherwise, I stay away from it. If I didn't use Facebook Marketplace I would delete my account entirely. I prefer email for communication.</p>
<h3>Business</h3>
<p>My main focus is on my business <a href="https://starcorelabs.com">StarcoreLabs.com</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/starcorelabs-main.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>I've had a few clients but I still have a lot of work ahead of me learning marketing to advertise to the right audience.
If you know anyone who needs UX/UI or Graphic Design services please send them to my business website. Thank you!</p>
<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>I've been tinkering with my computers, watching YouTube, watching Movies, and playing games.
Nothing exciting. I prefer to relax at home alone. That's what I've been up to.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. Have a great day!</p>
