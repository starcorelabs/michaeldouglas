  <h1>UX/UI Design</h1>
  <p>2021-04-20</p>
  <a href="/blog">Back to List</a>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/ui-design-example.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>After many years working as a UI Developer, I began to feel burned out by the heavy rules, long meetings, and slow pace of corporate web development. I enjoyed building things, but the bureaucracy made the work feel frustrating and limiting.</p>
<p>To fix this, I made a clear plan. In 2018, I spent most of my free time improving my UX/UI design skills. I read books, watched video courses, and studied design fundamentals. My goal was simple: move from UI Development into a UX/UI Design role where I could focus more on problem-solving and user experience.</p>
<p>In January 2021, I reached that goal. I transitioned into a full-time UX/UI Designer role, and I’ve been much happier ever since.</p>
<p>You might be wondering: <strong>What exactly is UX/UI Design?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s start by clearing up what it is <strong>not</strong>.</p>
<h2>What UX/UI Design Is NOT</h2>
<p>UX/UI Design is often confused with many other roles. It is <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Front-End or UI Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)</li>
<li>Social media or email marketing</li>
<li>KPI tracking or business analytics</li>
<li>Technical writing or copywriting</li>
<li>Google Analytics or SEO</li>
</ul>
<p>While designers may work closely with people in these roles, UX/UI Design focuses on something different.</p>
<h2>What UX/UI Design Really Is</h2>
<p>UX/UI Design includes two closely related disciplines that work together to shape digital products like websites and mobile apps.</p>
<h3>UX Design (User Experience)</h3>
<p>UX stands for <strong>User Experience</strong>. A UX Designer studies how people use a product and plans how it should work. This includes research, structure, and flow. The goal is to make the product easy, clear, and enjoyable to use.</p>
<h3>UI Design (User Interface)</h3>
<p>UI stands for <strong>User Interface</strong>. A UI Designer focuses on how the product looks. This includes layout, colors, typography, buttons, and visual consistency. UI design turns ideas and plans into clear, friendly screens users can interact with.</p>
<p>Together, UX and UI design help turn complex ideas into simple, usable digital experiences.</p>
<h2>Tools I Use</h2>
<p>My main design tool is <strong>Figma</strong>. It is a web-based design application, similar to Adobe XD, Photoshop, and Illustrator, it works on Mac, Windows, and Linux.</p>
<p>Figma allows me to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create wireframes and mockups</li>
<li>Design full user interfaces</li>
<li>Build interactive prototypes for web and mobile apps</li>
</ul>
<p>These designs act as blueprints for front-end developers, helping them build the final product accurately and efficiently.</p>
<h2>How I Learned UX/UI Design</h2>
<p>I built my education around a college-style curriculum I found online. I studied topics similar to those taught by well-known schools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>New York Institute of Art + Design</li>
<li>DePaul University</li>
<li>UC Berkeley Extension</li>
</ul>
<p>This helped me stay focused on real-world skills instead of trends or shortcuts.</p>
<h2>Design Fundamentals I Studied</h2>
<p>A strong foundation matters. I spent time learning core graphic design principles, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line, shape, and space</li>
<li>Color theory and contrast</li>
<li>Typography and hierarchy</li>
<li>Alignment, balance, and proximity</li>
<li>Repetition and consistency</li>
</ul>
<p>These basics show up in every good design, no matter the tool or trend.</p>
<h2>UX/UI Core Skills</h2>
<p>I also focused on UX/UI-specific skills, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>User research and usability</li>
<li>Personas and journey maps</li>
<li>User flows and wireframes</li>
<li>Accessibility and mobile-first design</li>
<li>Responsive layouts and prototypes</li>
</ul>
<p>These skills help ensure designs work for real people in real situations.</p>
<h2>Software and Tools</h2>
<p>Over time, I’ve worked with many design tools, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figma</li>
<li>Adobe Creative Cloud</li>
<li>Balsamiq</li>
<li>GIMP and Inkscape</li>
<li>Penpot</li>
</ul>
<p>Each tool has strengths, but the thinking behind the design matters more than the software.</p>
<h2>Learning Resources</h2>
<p>I learned through a mix of books and video courses. Some focused on design basics, others on UX thinking, and others on real-world advice designers don’t always learn in school. This mix helped me grow both creatively and professionally.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>UX/UI Design is about people, not pixels. It’s about understanding users, solving problems, and creating clear, friendly experiences. The tools and processes matter, but mindset and curiosity matter more.</p>
<p>Switching from UI Development to UX/UI Design was one of the best career decisions I’ve made. If you enjoy problem-solving, learning, and improving how people use technology, UX/UI Design is a rewarding path worth exploring.</p>
