  <h1>Why I Switched from Windows to Linux Mint</h1>
  <p>2018-12-13</p>
  <a href="/blog">Back to List</a>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/windows10.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>I used Windows 10 as my main operating system for about eight months. At first, it looked nice and had some interesting features. But after using it every day, small problems kept getting in the way. Over time, those problems added stress to my work.</p>
<p>Because of that, I decided to switch to <a href="https://linuxmint.com/download.php">Linux Mint with the Cinnamon Desktop</a>.</p>
<p>This is not about saying one system is “better” than another. Every tool depends on the user’s needs and workflow. If Windows works well for you, that’s great. You should keep using what helps you get things done. This is simply why Windows no longer worked for me.</p>
<h3>Problems I Had with Windows</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lack of Control</strong> <br/>
Windows often makes choices for the user. Updates install automatically, even when you are busy. You can pause them, but you cannot fully stop them. These updates slow the system and use internet data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Windows also pushes Microsoft tools like Edge, OneDrive, and built-in assistants. Even when I changed settings, Windows often ignored them. This made me feel like I was not in control of my own computer.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Privacy Concerns</strong> <br/>
Windows includes tracking features by default. It encourages users to sign in with an online account and stores files in cloud services like OneDrive. This data can be scanned and used for ads or AI training.</li>
</ol>
<p>New features like built-in AI tools raised even more concerns for me. I prefer an operating system that respects privacy and does not watch how I work.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>Forced Upgrades</strong> <br/>
Microsoft ended support for Windows 10 and pushed users toward Windows 11. This often requires newer hardware and a long setup process. I do not like being forced to upgrade a system that already works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confusing Menus</strong> <br/>
Windows menus feel layered and inconsistent. Simple settings are buried under many screens. Older versions of Windows were easier to understand. The newer design feels like pieces from different systems put together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stability Issues</strong> <br/>
Windows updates sometimes caused crashes or required restarts at bad times. Some software that worked fine on older versions became unstable. Even simple tasks like browsing the web felt slower because of background features.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why Linux Mint Works Better for Me</h3>
<p>After switching to Linux Mint, things felt simple and calm again.</p>
<ul>
<li>I control when updates happen</li>
<li>There are no ads or forced accounts</li>
<li>Drivers worked right away</li>
<li>The system runs fast and smoothly</li>
<li>All my software is free and open source</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, the system works with me, not against me. I can focus on my work instead of fixing my computer.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Linux Mint fits my workflow and values. It gives me control, respects my privacy, and stays out of the way. For me, that makes all the difference.</p>
<p>Everyone’s needs are different, but after making the switch, I see no reason to go back to Windows.</p>
