  <h1>No More Tech Support</h1>
  <p>2024-09-24</p>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/dell-laptop.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>For the last 10+ years, I've been the tech support person for my non-technical family. It's been hell!</p>
<p>Due to recent events, starting next Tuesday, October 1st, 2024 I will no longer provide tech support. This applies to everyone with no exceptions.</p>
<p>Below is a brief job description that explains the work I've done.</p>
<h3>Family Tech Support Job Description</h3>
<ul>
<li>Must have 3 to 5 years of experience working in a professional environment as a technical support agent.</li>
<li>You must have experience using secure remote access tools to connect with different devices for troubleshooting and administration.</li>
<li>You must have a deep understanding of Microsoft Windows 10. You must know how to install it, update it, troubleshoot problems, install programs, set up printers, and administrate security.</li>
<li>You will need strong skills in computer networking, know how the internet works, and ensure all wired and wireless devices are online but only accessible to authorized people.</li>
<li>You're expected to know how to securely access and manage a wide range of online accounts, including email, bank, PayPal, bills, social media, streaming services, and other online accounts while preventing unauthorized access.</li>
<li>You will be responsible for generating strong unique passwords for all devices and accounts and storing them in a secure location. Along with setting up two-factor authentication and actively resetting all passwords every few months to make it difficult for hackers to crack them.</li>
<li>You must be patient with non-technical elderly people who have trouble hearing, seeing, and remembering. You will have to do the work for them.</li>
<li>They will ask endless questions about how technical things work. You'll be expected to explain complex topics in simple terms. You will have to repeat yourself many times. There are some technical topics they will not understand no matter how many different ways you explain them. Instead, they will make up wrong answers based on what feels right.</li>
<li>You must understand how to use and update the Linux Mint operating system. It is used as a base for a Jellyfin media server.</li>
<li>You will be expected to troubleshoot Roku devices connected to TVs that access Jellyfin and other online streaming services.</li>
<li>You must be on-call 24/7 for any technical emergencies or random questions.</li>
<li>There is no pay for this job and sometimes people will be rude, demanding, impatient, insulting, and talk down to you while you're working.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have technical questions you can look up the answers on Google or YouTube. If that doesn't work you'll have to hire someone else. Don't text or call me. I'm not involved.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>
</p>
