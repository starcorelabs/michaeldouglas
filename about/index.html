<h3>Hello, I'm Michael<h3>
<p>I am a UX/UI and Graphic Designer who enjoys solving problems with clear maps, user flows, and prototypes. I ask smart questions, look for the real problem, and pay close attention to details. My goal is to design simple, easy-to-use interfaces that help people enjoy using digital products.</p>
<p>With a background in both UX/UI Design and Front-End Development, I understand how design and technology work together. This helps me create solutions that look great and work smoothly. I work with small businesses and mid-sized organizations to turn ideas into clear, effective digital experiences.</p>
<h3>How I Got Here</h3>
<p>I have worked in many roles throughout my career. I started in Sales, then worked as a Technical Support Agent in a call center. From there, I moved into Front-End Development and later into UX/UI Design. Each role helped me build strong problem-solving, communication, and technical skills.</p>
<p>My move into freelance design began after a mass layoff from my last corporate UX Design job. As more companies continued large layoffs, the design job market became unstable, highly competitive, and filled with unrealistic expectations for the few roles still available.</p>
<p>That experience pushed me to take control of my career. I decided to combine my technical background, creative thinking, and love of problem-solving to offer freelance design services. Today, I focus on helping clients solve real business problems through clear, thoughtful, and effective design solutions.</p>
<h3>Empathetic and Patient</h3>
<p>I care deeply about the people who use the products I design. I always stand up for users and work to make their experience clear, simple, and easy to understand. I believe great design is not just about how something looks, but how everything is organized and works together to make an app smooth, helpful, and easy to use.</p>
<h3>Unique Perspective</h3>
<p>I bring a unique point of view to every project. I listen carefully to understand real problems, map out what is not working, and design stronger solutions. My experience across different jobs, life situations, and design research helps me see challenges from many angles. This allows me to create thoughtful designs that truly solve problems and work well for real people.</p>
<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>I’m passionate about open-source technology and enjoy using tools that are open, flexible, and community-driven. I use Linux Mint on my desktop, laptop, and home lab computers, and I choose open-source software whenever possible for both my personal and professional work.</p>
<p>When I’m not designing, I enjoy setting up home lab servers, testing new open-source tools, playing video games, and relaxing with a good sci-fi show. These hobbies keep me curious and inspired, and they help me bring fresh ideas and creative thinking into my design work.</p>
