<p>Hello, I'm Michael.</p>
<p>Welcome to my blog where I write about my experiences, interests, and thoughts on various topics.</p>
<p>Here are a few things to know about me:</p>
<h3>Career</h3>
<p>I was a Front-End Developer who burnt out writing code. So, I switched careers to UX/UI Design. During my last corporate design job, I focused on designing graphical user interfaces for web and mobile applications. I worked on the following types of projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corporate websites</li>
<li>E-commerce platforms</li>
<li>Web and mobile applications</li>
<li>Single landing pages</li>
<li>Static sites</li>
<li>Graphics for marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, in April of 2023, I was part of a mass layoff that eliminated my whole division of 200 people. This included our department manager Jon and my direct manager under him, George.</p>
<p>After struggling to find another corporate job for six months, and watching other companies preform mass layoffs, I decided working in the corporate world is too risky so I started my own business. Now, I run <a href="https://starcorelabs.com">Starcore Labs</a> offering design-related products and services.</p>
<h3>Boundaries</h3>
<p>In my youth, I was too naive, kind, trusting, and tried to help others. In return, I was lied to, used, insulted, and betrayed. Over the years, I've created personal boundaries to stop negative people from entering my life.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Prevention</strong>: I avoid people, places, and situations that might cause me problems now or in the future. I'm too old and tired to tolerate immaturity, games, disrespect, hostility, or attempts at manipulation and dominance. Don't bother.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trust and Respect</strong>: My trust and respect must be earned over time through consistent words and actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anti-Discrimination</strong>: I don't tolerate discrimination or prejudice of any kind. No ageism, racism, sexism, or intolerance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Braggers</strong>: You will get no attention, validation, or admiration from me. Don't waste my time bragging about what you've accomplished, where you traveled, or what you've bought. If a it doesn't add a day to my life or a dollar to my pocket, I don't care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I'm Not a Therapist</strong>: I don't want to hear your tragic backstory or your current problems. I haven't fixed my issues so how the hell do you expect me to fix yours? I won't ask you to listen to my complaints, to fix my problems, or to be something you're not. Don't &quot;should&quot; on me and I won't &quot;should&quot; on you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Main Character Syndrome</strong>: If you think the world revolves around you, or that you have any authority in my life, go pound sand! If you're not here to help me accomplish my goals, buy my products and services, or at least cheer me on, then leave me alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I Don't Work for Free</strong>: If you want my ideas, suggestions, or advice on any topic we can negotiate a price. If you need graphic design services my business website has a list of prepaid plans. Otherwise, search on Google for free information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Heath</h3>
<p>My physical and mental health strongly influence my mindset, worldview, and decision-making.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm mildly autistic which means I am logical, detail-oriented, and analytical. I don't operate on vibes, pick up on vague language, or unspoken emotion-based social cues. I work best with clear specific language.</li>
<li>I have <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193">Type II Diabetes</a> which I manage through a strict sugar-free diet. I avoid seafood because I think its gross.</li>
<li>I don't smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs, consume caffeine or sugar. (caffeine gives me headaches)</li>
<li>I have allergies to mold, pollen, cut grass, cologne, perfume, oil diffusers, scented candles, incense, smoke, and pet fur. Any exposure usually causes me migraine headaches that last a few days. This is why I prefer staying inside.</li>
<li>Sometimes, when I'm stressed, I suffer from insomnia.</li>
<li>Due to my health issues I'm in a constant state of fatigue. Which means I have limited physical and social energy per day.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mindset</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have a positive growth mindset where I'm constantly learning new things.</li>
<li>I'm motivated by an inner drive to create things and be better than I was yesterday.</li>
<li>I view debates and competition as an annoying waste of time.</li>
<li>I use Psychology and Stoicism to evaluate and interact with people while remaining calm.</li>
<li>I focus on what I can do to create positive solutions. While letting go of what's out of my control.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Values</h3>
<ul>
<li>Critical Thinking, Logic and Reason</li>
<li>Evidence-Based Decision-Making</li>
<li>Creativity</li>
<li>Humor</li>
<li>Maturity</li>
<li>Empathy</li>
<li>Kindness</li>
<li>Patience</li>
<li>Respect</li>
<li>Honesty</li>
<li>Integrity</li>
<li>Cooperation</li>
<li>Self-Control</li>
<li>Self-Discipline</li>
<li>Skills and Knowledge</li>
</ul>
<h3>Worldview</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Individualist</strong>. I don't tolerate people or groups telling me what to do. I decide how I live my life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abundance</strong>. I know there are more than enough resources to go around. I'm confident in my skills to create or earn what I need and want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Critical Thinking</strong>. I remain calm and skeptical, take time to think critically, and ask questions. I attempt to verify information and claims before accepting them as facts. If they cannot be verified, they are not accepted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Silence</strong>. I'd rather spend quiet time alone than in loud crowded places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean</strong>. I prefer clean, organized, and sanitized indoor environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I'm an Atheist</strong>. That means I don't believe in any gods, the supernatural, astrology, psychic powers, ghosts, zombies, werewolves, vampires, witches, demons, aliens, or anything without physical evidence. I don't like wishful, emotional, delusional, or magical thinking. I prefer critical thinking, logic, reason, science, and dealing with reality at all times. Don't waste my time trying to convert me to your religion. It will only annoy me and I'll stop talking to you. Believe whatever you like, just leave me out of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I'm Anti-Political</strong>. Looking at voting from a different perspective. It seems a bit ridiculous to hold a popularity contest to allow an unqualified person to run a country. Imagine if we used popularity contests to decide who's qualified for other jobs. You'd end up with likable people in jobs they lack the skills to do. If I need surgery I'll pick the doctor who earned his medical degree, not the one who's the most charming.</p>
<p>If you wanted to be a software developer working at Google. You'd need a college degree, years of previous experience, and industry contacts to verify you know what you're doing. Along with being likable and easy to work with. Then you must pass four rounds of interviews with skill tests to qualify. All I'm saying is running for any public office should have more requirements than being a citizen over a certain age and winning a popularity contest. Especially if the winner gets to command an army.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, American Politics is run by the old golden rule, &quot;Those who have the gold, make the rules&quot;. In my opinion, we have the illusion of choice and freedom. Billionaires and special interest groups send hundreds of thousands of dollars every month to politicians and judges. They call it lobbying, but it's bribery to get preferential treatment. Their greed and need for control caused our economic problems. They blame ethnic groups to stir up fear and anger. They want the population confused and arguing amongst themselves so they can continue to control things from behind the scenes and profit. With all that in mind, it's a waste of my time to talk about politics when I don't have the money or influence to change anything. Because while lobbying is allowed, my vote doesn't matter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>My interests have changed as I've gotten older. Here's the current list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stoicism</li>
<li>Psychology</li>
<li>Science</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Graphic Design</li>
<li>UX/UI Design</li>
<li>Comic Books</li>
<li>The card game: Magic The Gathering</li>
<li>Video Games</li>
<li>Anime</li>
<li>TV Shows</li>
<li>Movies</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you find my blog entertaining.<br />
Thanks for stopping by and have a nice day!</p>
