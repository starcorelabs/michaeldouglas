<p>I offer UX/UI Design and Graphic Design services that turn complex ideas into simple, easy-to-use designs. I work closely with my clients to understand their goals and solve real business problems. Every project focuses on clarity, ease of use, and real results. My designs are made to look great and work smoothly for the people who use them. My goal is to help clients build strong brands, grow their business, and create designs that make a lasting impact.</p>

    <h3>Design Research</h3>
    <p>I start every project with careful research. I learn about your users, your market, and your business goals. This helps me understand what problems need to be solved and what success looks like. The research gives me a strong plan to follow, so every design choice is clear, thoughtful, and based on real needs, not guesses.</p>

    <h3>Branding and Logo Design</h3>
    <p>I create clear and memorable brand identities that show who you are and what you stand for. From logos to visual styles, my designs help your business look professional, build trust, and stand out. Every brand I design is made to be easy to recognize and consistent across all platforms, so your audience remembers you and feels confident choosing you.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>Sitemaps and User Flows</h3>
    <p>I create clear sitemaps and user flows that show how people move through your website or product. These simple visual maps help organize content, guide users step by step, and make sure everything is easy to find and use. This planning helps create a smooth experience that feels natural and makes sense to your users.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p>Wireframes are simple layout plans that show where content, buttons, and features will go. They help set the structure of each page and show how everything works before design begins. This step makes sure the layout is clear, easy to use, and built with the user in mind.</p>

    <h3>Full-Color Prototypes</h3>
    <p>I create detailed, full-color prototypes that show exactly how your product will look and work. These interactive designs let you see and test the experience before any development starts, helping you feel confident, catch issues early, and move forward with clarity.</p>

    <h3>Custom Design Projects</h3>
    <p>I create custom design solutions made just for your business. Each project is carefully planned to match your goals, solve real problems, and support your growth. From start to finish, I focus on clear visuals, smart structure, and designs that work well for your audience.</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial Consultation</strong> - I begin with a free 30-minute Zoom meeting to learn about your business, goals, and design needs. During this call, I ask clear questions, listen carefully, and make sure I fully understand what you want to achieve. I also review my pricing packages together so you can choose the option that best fits your project, timeline, and budget. This meeting helps ensure everyone is aligned before any design work begins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Planning and Strategy</strong> - I plan every project before work begins using a clear step-by-step approach. First, I gather all goals, requirements, and important details. Then I create a simple project plan that outlines the scope, key milestones, and final deliverables. This roadmap keeps the project organized and ensures the work stays focused from start to finish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design Phase</strong> - During the design phase, I create the graphics and visuals outlined in your project plan. You will receive draft designs by email to review at each step. You can approve the work or request changes, and we will make updates as needed until everything meets your expectations. I follow the agreed timeline, stick to the project scope, and provide clear progress updates so you always know what stage the project is in. My goal is to deliver high-quality designs on time while keeping the process simple, organized, and stress-free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verification and Revisions</strong> - After the design phase is complete, the client reviews the drafts and notes any changes they want. All feedback is collected at once, and I then make the requested updates in a single, organized revision round. This process helps ensure accuracy, saves time, and delivers a polished final result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Final Delivery</strong> - Once all designs and revisions are finished, I schedule a final review meeting to make sure everything looks correct and meets your goals. After you approve the work, I prepare the final files in the agreed formats. All deliverables, including the original source files, are neatly organized and packaged into one ZIP file so you can easily download and use them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>I respect your privacy and keep your company name and project details private by default. After the project is finished, I may ask for permission to feature the work in my portfolio. This would include a short description, a link to your website, and screenshots of the design. Sharing completed projects helps me show my skills and reach new clients. If you prefer to keep your project private, that is completely okay and will always be respected.</p>
<h3>Human-Centered Design</h3>
<p>I do not use artificial intelligence tools in my design process. Every design is created by hand with care and attention to detail. This ensures high-quality, human-made work that is thoughtful, original, and built to solve real problems, not generated by a machine.</p>
<h3>Pricing Packages</h3>
<p>I do not charge by the hour. Instead, I offer four clear pricing packages that cover most common design needs. This makes costs simple, predictable, and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Each package is paid in full before work begins. This allows me to focus fully on your project without delays, invoices, or payment follow-ups. It also ensures a smooth process, clear expectations, and a strong commitment on both sides from the start.</p>

<h3>Revisions and Changes</h3>
<p>Each pricing package includes a set number of bulk revisions. During the Design Phase, I follow the agreed plan and create draft designs for you to review. As you receive each draft, you can make a list of what you like and what you want changed.</p>
<p>As long as your requests stay within the project’s agreed scope, I will apply all approved changes during the Verification and Revisions Phase. Larger projects usually include more drafts and revisions to make sure everything turns out right.</p>
<p>Any unused revisions expire when the project deadline is reached. If you request additional changes after the project is complete, a new pricing package will be required. This keeps the process fair, organized, and on schedule for both of us.</p>
