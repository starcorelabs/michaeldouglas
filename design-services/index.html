<h3>Business Hours</h3>
<p>My business hours are Monday through Friday 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM EST. I'm not open on weekends.</p>
<p>I'm also unavailable during the following holidays:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Year's Eve</li>
<li>New Year's Day</li>
<li>Independence Day</li>
<li>Halloween</li>
<li>Thanksgiving Eve</li>
<li>Thanksgiving Day</li>
<li>Christmas Eve</li>
<li>Christmas Day</li>
</ul>
<h3>Design Services I Offer</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branding and Logo Design</strong> - Icon, brand mark, or word mark that sets your product or business apart.</li>
<li><strong>Sitemaps, Flow Charts, and User Flows</strong> - Visual decision-making maps.</li>
<li><strong>Wireframes</strong> - This helps define the layout and placement of components per screen.</li>
<li><strong>Prototypes</strong> - A full-color blueprint of what a software interface should look like.</li>
<li><strong>Landing Pages</strong> - A single-page design for email sign-up or a single product sale.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Projects</strong> - Anything design-related outside my standard templates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Free Consultation</strong> - We schedule a phone call or video meeting to discuss your project goals.</li>
<li><strong>Contract Review</strong> - We review <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DlAEyUzCQSFkfiJ8FR0rNDFEF8jF-bS9IF88t8J1QEI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">my contract</a> and pricing options. Payments are processed online through Stripe.</li>
<li><strong>Trello</strong> - I create a workspace for you. You break down your project into single tasks and add them as cards in Trello. Then arrange your tasks by priority from top to bottom.</li>
<li><strong>Tasks and Revisions</strong> - I work on each task one at a time. You get unlimited revisions on each task. Trello sends you an email when a task is marked complete.</li>
<li><strong>Deliverables</strong> - Completed tasks include downloadable deliverables.</li>
<li><strong>Time Frame</strong> - Depending on the complexity of the request, tasks are completed in 1 - 5 business days.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Design Process</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Discover and Empathize</strong> - During our meeting, I learn about your goals and pain points.</li>
<li><strong>Define</strong> - We discuss and collaborate to clearly define the problem and the scope of the design solution.</li>
<li><strong>Ideate</strong> - I map the project as a flow chart or user flow. Then I make a few versions of wireframes or mockups to provide various options for you to choose from.</li>
<li><strong>Prototype</strong> - Once we've agreed on the layout and placement of components, I create a full-color prototype.</li>
<li><strong>Review</strong> - We plan another meeting to review the prototype together. This gives you one last chance to make any changes to the design.</li>
<li><strong>Delivery</strong> - Once you're happy with the final design, I complete the work and combine all the project files into a zip file and add them to Trello for downloading.</li>
</ol>
<h3>No AI</h3>
<p>These days it seems like LLMs and generative AI are everywhere. While I acknowledge they are powerful tools capable of producing results fast. The quality of those results varies wildly depending on the AI and models being used.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't agree with the businesses who've built their models using data from stolen sources without credit to the original creators. Plus, without legal regulations in place, many of these AI tools are being used to cause people harm.</p>
<p>Because of these reasons I do not use any artificial intelligence tools in my design process. Everything I do is hand-polished pixels to ensure human-made quality.</p>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>I offer two flexible pricing options:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Project Based</strong> - After discussing the scope of your project and the requested time frame to complete it. I calculate a flat fee for the entire project. This is a good option for people who know what they want.</li>
<li><strong>Value-Based Pricing</strong> - Value-based pricing is based on a percentage of the value you receive from the completed design. This option is useful for large projects or teams that hold meetings to make decisions.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Upfront Payment Policy</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, in the past, people have attempted to get free work from me. So, I've instituted an upfront payment policy.</p>
<p>I do not offer hourly plans, split payments, or invoicing. Because I don’t have time to chase people for outstanding payments.</p>
<p>Before I begin work, my contract must be signed by an authorized individual, and the project quote must be paid in full.</p>
<h3>No Refunds</h3>
<p>Due to the time-consuming nature of my high-quality work, I do not offer refunds on any work I perform.</p>
<h3>Policy Updates</h3>
<p>This page and these policies are subject to change without notice. Please revisit this page to stay informed on my current policies.</p>
